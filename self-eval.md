# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

    **It was daunting at times and a lot to keep track of, but I found if I broke down the question into parts (as well as reference my notes as needed), I could manage the problem better.**

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

    **My workflow is definitely better than when I first started. I am doing a better job of adhering to my calendar, as well as being mindful of when I am entering a state of unproductive struggle, so I can step away for a few minutes to reset.**

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

    **I need to take care of myself, first and foremost - getting a good night's sleep, eating/snacking at regular intervals, working out, etc. This of course goes back to managing my time thoughtfully and staying up to date with my calendar. I don't currently need any support, but if that changes, I will certainly reach out.**
